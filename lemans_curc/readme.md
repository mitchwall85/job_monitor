## LeMANS CURC
These files will search for running jobs on  CU Research Computing (CURC), create convergence files for them, and plot. 

After cloning this repo to CURC, add the directory to $PATH. Then use `job_monitor.sh` from any directory to list convergence data for each running job. Run `makeTecplotConvergence.sh` and `makeGnuConvPlot_total` to do the same thing for an indivdual job regardless if it is running or not. ## LeMANS CURC
